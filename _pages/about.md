I am a PhD student in computer science at [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/). I previously majored in finance and systems science, thus holding a Bachelor's degree in Economics and a Master's degree in Science. 

My main focus is on cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies such as large language models. My research areas include **model distillation**, **content saferty**, and **interpretability**. In the future, I am inclined to study **post-training** of models and **reinforcement learning** training techniques.
